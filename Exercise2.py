# EXERCISE 2
#Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
#Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
#Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
#Print the value of the sum to the console.


num1 = 8
num2 = 10           # the following two declares the variables of the two numbers 8 and 10 respectively.
numsum = (num1 + num2) # this variable holds the formula of the sum of two numbers. that is, both of them added.
print (numsum)
